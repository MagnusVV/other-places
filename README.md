## https://github.com/hedlundemma/public, or Kino Koszyk
A collaborative project between DD22 (digital designers) and WU (web dev). The existing Kino Koszyk website was in need of a total remake, but still with the same CMS (WordPress). We were divided into teams of four from each class, so each team consisted of eight people. DD interviwed the website owners, and from that created a multi-page prototype wich then WU would use to build the website and an updated dashboard to match it. The owners would then pick a new website from one of the finished choices.
